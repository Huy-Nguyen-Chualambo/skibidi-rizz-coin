# 📄 Project Summary: SkibidiRizz Token (SRT)

## 1. Project Context
*   **Course**: Fintech and Applications
*   **Assignment**: Final Project (Group of 5)
*   **Theme**: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) & Web3 Meme Ecosystem
*   **Status**: Completed Academic Prototype

## 2. Executive Summary
SkibidiRizz Token is a Web3-enabled community platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates how meme culture can be leveraged to build decentralized communities using a "Task-to-Earn" airdrop model. The project successfully integrates wallet authentication, cryptographic verification, and real-time blockchain data into a modern, high-performance web interface.

## 3. Key Achievements
*   **Hybrid Web3 Stack**: Built using Next.js 15, Solidity, Prisma, and Supabase.
*   **Secure Authentication**: Implemented Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE), eliminating the need for traditional passwords and enhancing user privacy.
*   **Gas-Optimized Distribution**: Developed a signature-based airdrop contract that reduces gas costs for the project owner while maintaining decentralized security.
*   **Live Blockchain Dashboard**: Created a real-time statistics panel fetching data directly from the Sepolia Testnet.
*   **Premium UI/UX**: Designed a high-fidelity "Cyberpunk/Neon" themed interface to wowed users and simulate a professional DeFi product.

## 4. Technical Specifications
*   **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)
*   **Token Standard**: ERC-20 (Fixed Supply: 1,000,000 SRT)
*   **Security Protocol**: ECDSA (secp256k1) Signature Verification for Airdrops.
*   **Authentication**: JWT-based session management with wallet-signed nonces.

## 5. Development Reflection (Academic)
This project provided hands-on experience in managing the lifecycle of a blockchain product: from smart contract design and deployment to building a complex backend bridge and a responsive frontend. It highlights the challenges of **Blockchain Interoperability** and **Web3 UX**, proving that decentralized apps can be as smooth and intuitive as traditional Web2 applications.
